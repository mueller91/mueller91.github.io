In 2017, the first <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10135"> Tacotron System </a> opened up the world of audio deepfakes - computer genereated audio designed to mimic any given voice.
In order to showcase this thread and sensititze the audience, we developed a deepfake system which can clone a target voice - and applied it to German chanellor Angela Merkel.

This interface allows a user to enter any text the wish, and have it said in the voice of the target person - in this case, Angela Merkel.
While we use it only for demonstration purposes, an attacker may use this technology
- to commit fraud <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessedamiani/2019/09/03/a-voice-deepfake-was-used-to-scam-a-ceo-out-of-243000/?sh=36ca45292241"> (see this CEO who has been scammed out of 243.000$) </a>, or 
- to extract sensitive information <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/22/european-mps-targeted-by-deepfake-video-calls-imitating-russian-opposition"> (see here: European MPs targeted by deepfake video calls imitating Russian opposition) </a>,
- etc.

That's why we use the audio generated by our system to design and train deepfake detection systems, i.e. artificial intelligence specifialized to detect fake audio.
