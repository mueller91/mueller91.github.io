I'm a computer science PhD student at Technical University of Munich (TUM), and work as a deep learning security expert at Fraunhofer AISEC. 
My research interests include
- deep learning for <a href="projects/creation/"> text-to-speech synethesis</a>,
- deep learning for <a href="projects/detection/"> automated spoofing detection </a>, and
- security of machine learning, especially adversarial data poisoning attacks and the <a href="projects/labelfix"> correctness of machine learning datasets</a>.

I'm also interested in <a href="teaching">teaching</a>, see 
- my courses at Technical Unversity of Munich, and
- the certified deep-learning course via Fraunhofer Academy.
