I am a computer science PhD student at Technical University of Munich, and work as a deep learning security expert at Fraunhofer AISEC. 
My research interests include
- deep learning for <a href="projects/creation/"> text-to-speech synethesis </a>
- deep learning for <a href="projects/detection/"> automated spoofing detection </a>
- security of machine learning, especially adversarial data poisoning attacks and <a href="projects/labelfix"> Correctness of ML-Dataset </a>

I'm also interested in teaching, see 
- my courses at technical unversity of munich, and
- the certified deep-learning course via Fraunhofer academy.
